# Impact of Uber Rides on Taxi Rides

## Background: Relationship Between NYC Taxi Rides and Uber Rides

- Understanding the **elasticity of cab demand with respect to the number of Uber rides** is very important for assessing how ride-sharing services impact traditional taxi usage. Elasticity measures the responsiveness of taxi demand to changes in the number of Uber rides:

- **Negative Elasticity**:

  - Indicates that as the number of Uber rides **increases**, the demand for taxis **decreases**.

  - It also suggests that Uber is substituting traditional taxi services, with people choosing Uber over taxis when it's readily available (more likely in this context).

- **Positive Elasticity**:

  - It means that as the number of Uber rides increases, taxi demand also increases (less likely in this context).

  - Suggests a complementary relationship between Uber and taxi services.

# NYC Taxi Rides Data

- **The following two questions will involve data other than the Uber rides pickup files.**

- Specifically, we will use data from:
  
  - NYC taxis,
  
  - weather (rainfall) data, and
  
  - some files that will be used to merge / link the data together.

- Yellow taxis

  - Can pick up passengers anywhere in the five boroughs of New York City.
  
  - They are also known as medallion taxis.

- Green taxis

  - Also known as "boro taxis", these taxis can pick up passengers in the outer boroughs and in Manhattan above East 96th and West 110th Streets.
  
  - They cannot pick up passengers below East 96th Street and West 110th Street in Manhattan, or at LaGuardia or John F. Kennedy International Airports.

Total and Average Trips
Yellow Cabs dominate trip volume in Manhattan for June 2015, with over 11 million total trips and an average of ~372,000 daily trips.
Uber is second, with about 2 million total trips and ~66,000 daily trips, indicating strong market penetration but still significantly trailing Yellow Cabs.
Green Cabs show the least activity in Manhattan, likely due to their primary operation in outer boroughs, with only ~460,000 trips and ~15,000 daily trips.
Day-of-Week Patterns
Uber trips peak on Tuesdays, with a gradual decline toward Sunday. This may reflect commuting or business-related travel early in the week.
Yellow Cabs follow a similar trend, peaking on Tuesdays and dropping off on Sundays, though they maintain consistently high volume throughout.
Green Cabs exhibit more modest fluctuations, but their trend aligns loosely with the others, also peaking mid-week and dipping on Sundays.
Observations
Yellow Cab dominance suggests that traditional taxis were still the primary mode of transport in Manhattan in 2015, despite Uber’s rising popularity.
Weekday demand—especially Tuesday—outpaces weekend use, possibly highlighting commuter-heavy traffic patterns.
Sunday drop-offs are noticeable across all services, indicating reduced rider activity.
