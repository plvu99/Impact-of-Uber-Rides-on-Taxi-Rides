# Impact of Uber Rides on Taxi Rides

## Background: Relationship Between NYC Taxi Rides and Uber Rides

- Understanding the **elasticity of cab demand with respect to the number of Uber rides** is very important for assessing how ride-sharing services impact traditional taxi usage. Elasticity measures the responsiveness of taxi demand to changes in the number of Uber rides:

- **Negative Elasticity**:

  - Indicates that as the number of Uber rides **increases**, the demand for taxis **decreases**.

  - It also suggests that Uber is substituting traditional taxi services, with people choosing Uber over taxis when it's readily available (more likely in this context).

- **Positive Elasticity**:

  - It means that as the number of Uber rides increases, taxi demand also increases (less likely in this context).

  - Suggests a complementary relationship between Uber and taxi services.

# NYC Taxi Rides Data

- **The following two questions will involve data other than the Uber rides pickup files.**

- Specifically, we will use data from:
  
  - NYC taxis,
  
  - weather (rainfall) data, and
  
  - some files that will be used to merge / link the data together.
